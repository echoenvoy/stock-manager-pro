To ensure flexibility, scalability, and accessibility, the system was developed in **two distinct versions**, each designed for different usage scenarios:

---

#### ⚡ **1. Frontend-Only Version (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, LocalStorage)**

🚀 **Fast, lightweight, and works offline**

🎯 Ideal for demos, small businesses, and devices without internet access

---

#### 🐍 **2. Fullstack Version with Flask Backend** (SAME CODE HTML & CSS )

🔗 **Flask API** handling all business logic

🗄️ **Database integration** (PostgreSQL / SQLite)

🔐 **Secure authentication** (session or token-based)

📡 **Real-time operations** and multi-user support

📈 **Scalable**, reliable, and ready for production environments
